# Zetta Technical Interview Task - QA Engineer

## Overview of the tasks/projects

Three of the tasks have their own separate branches:
- Acceptance criteria implementation - `dv/selenium-java-task`
- Simple Site Crawl - `dv/crawler-python-task`
- API Test - `dv/api-javascript-task`

For the last task, "Git Usage, Best Practices, and Submission Details," I have followed most of the criteria, though not everything is perfect. For instance, I would not typically use the main branch for a single README file while having completely different code in separate branches.

To showcase diversity, I have used Java, JavaScript, and Python.

### dv/selenium-java-task

For the UI tests, I would have preferred to use JavaScript/TypeScript with Cypress or Playwright. Although with Cypress, the approach would differ, as it does not support multiple tabs like Selenium does. Perhaps I could have indexed the dynamic results from the page, then visited each URL and so on.

### dv/crawler-python-task

The crawler also utilizes Selenium, but Amazon's site has a lot of dynamic content which required a UI framework to navigate through some of the menus. While JavaScript would be my preferred choice for most tasks, Python was well-suited for this one.

### dv/api-javascript-task

Although I have mainly used Java for API testing, I have used JavaScript for this task, as the Java slot was already occupied in the Selenium task.

## Important note

Thank you for taking your time to review my tasks!
